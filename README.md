### Introduction
This is intended as a brief introduction to microcontrollers using the [esp8266][esp8266-wiki]. The goal is to get started and gain insight on what we can do with a cheap board and some basic coding.

The greatest advantage of the ESP8266 over micro-controllers like the Arduino is that the former has built-in WiFi support.

There are three components we will be using through this tutorial: hardware (ESP8266), firmware (NodeMCU), and software (Lua).

The ESP8266 is a $4 WiFi module with an ARM processor. NodeMCU is firmware and a development kit that makes it palatable to program ESP8266 modules using the [Lua][lua] programming language.

You need some basic programming knowledge, you need to know how to open a terminal and execute a script or type in a command, and find your way around Github.


_NOTE_:

The following tutorial has been tested with a NodeMCU dev board and using a Mac OS. It is possible to follow up using a Windows computer but there might be differences- i.e.  how to flash the board or how to use some of the tools.


### Materials
The list of materials is intentionally short. We can get up and running pretty fast.

Hardware:
* [NodeMCU dev board][amazon-esp]
* [Micro USB cable][amazon-usb]

Software:
* [esptool][esptool] Used to flash NodeMCU devkit
* [SiLabs Drivers][silabs-drivers] Used to communicate with the devkit
* [ESPlorer][esplorer] IDE used to program the devkit

Binaries:
* [NodeMCU firmware][esp-binaries] Latest release of the NodeMCU firmware

### Set up
To make things easier all dependencies are bundled in the [bin][bin-directory] directory. We will go over how to install all the different tools.


There is also a `bash` script to bootstrap via CLI:

```
$ curl -SLs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goliatone/wee-things-workshop/master/bin/bootstrap | bash
```

What follows is a step by step guide on what the script automates for you.

#### espytool

We will first install **esptool** in order to flash our boards. It's a `python` script which can be run using the Mac's default `python`. Open terminal and cd to the directory **esptool** directory and run the following command:

```
python setup.py install
```

This will install `esptool.py` system-wide.

If you do not want a global install you can follow the [instructions][esptool-install] on the repo to use the tool locally. It's really easy.

#### SiLabs Drivers

From the SiLabs driver [download page][silabs-drivers]:

>The CP210x USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers are required for device operation as a Virtual COM Port to facilitate host communication with CP210x products.

In order for your computer to communicate with the devkit you need to have installed special drivers. You can find the download [link here][silabs-drivers].

The ESP8266 runs a Lua interpreter and you can send in commands and read out results over serial.

_NOTE:_

This requires your computer to restart, save your work.


#### NodeMCU firmware
You can find the latest NodeMCU firmware at their github repository, in the release page following this [link][esp-binaries].

The ESP8266 chip comes loaded with an AT command set, and it's meant to be used by an external controller like an Arduino driving the chip over serial.

#### Flashing the NodeMCU
In this step, we are going to flash our devkit with the NodeMCU binaries downloaded before so we can start loading programs to the board. It sounds intimidating, but it's quite simple actually.

We already downloaded the NodeMCU [firmware][firmware], installed the SiLabs drivers, and have **esptool** installed.

Connect the board to the computer using the USB cable.

From the project's main directory, open terminal and `cd` to the **bin** directory where the **nodemcu_float_0.9.6-dev_20150704.bin** file is located.

We need to put the board in flash mode. To do so hold down the board's **FLASH** button and press the **RST** button at the same time. You should see an LED blink on the board.

Type the following command in terminal and press enter:

```
sudo python esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0  write_flash 0x00000 nodemcu_float_0.9.6-dev_20150704.bin
```

Now unplug the USB cable and plug it again.

Congratulations, we now have a board properly flashed and we are ready to start uploading code. We will do so using an IDE.

---
### ESPlorer
You can download the ESPlorer IDE from [here][esplorer]. However, we will be using the version bundled with this tutorial for convenience.

_NOTE:_ ESPlorer requires [Java SE version 7][java-se] and above installed.

First, we need to un-zip the **ESPlorer.zip** file.

On Mac to open the IDE you need to do so from **terminal**. Open a new **terminal** window, `cd` to the **ESPlorer** directory created after uncompressing the zip file, and type this command in your terminal:

```
java â€“jar "ESPlorer.jar"
```

This command wil open up the IDE, it should look something similar to this:

![ESPlorer](./images/esplorer-001.png)

*NOTE:*
Some online resources tell you to `sudo` the command in order to run the **ESPlorer** IDE. Most _likely_ you will be able to leave it out.

### More on ESP8266

The [ESP8266][espressif] is a microcontroller with 2.4 GHz WiFi capabilities supporting the WPA/WPA2 [protocols][wpa-protocols], general-purpose input/output (GPIO), Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and pulse-width modulation (PWM). The chip operates at 80Mhz, has a 64KB boot ROM, 64KB instruction RAM, and 96KB data RAM.

### Colofon
And with this we conclude the boring setup process. We are ready to start coding and making things. We will start by doing the mandatory [hello world][hello-world] tutorial which will teach us how to load code into a devkit board. Next, we will do the classical [hello world of electronics][hello-blink] and get an LED blinking.

If you are not familiar with the Lua programming language you can always follow a quick intro tutorial. Check out the Lua links in the [Resources](#resources) section.

You should also check out NodeMCU's [API wiki page][nodemcu-wiki-api]. It covers succinctly all the different modules and their methods.

If you are new to programming, there is an online tutorial following the *Learn the Hard Way* method that uses Lua. [Here][learn-lua]

Lua has a package manager, [LuaRocks][luarocks]. A package manager is a set of tools that help you install, upgrade, configure, and manage software packages, or modules, and their dependencies. From the LuaRocks website:
>LuaRocks allows you to create and install Lua modules as self-contained packages called rocks.
